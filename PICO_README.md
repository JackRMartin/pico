# picoShell
Your one stop shop for learning how to code and collaborating with peers


## Best Hidden Feature
 - Upload files to your picoShell computer by dragging and dropping onto the folder-mode area (top right folder icon)


## Some Things to Note
 - picoShell 1.0 is a terminal emulator, and although you can do many of the things you do in 	linux containers, we do not currently support any interactive commands such as "python" "npm init" and "node". A workaround would be creating a file and simply pressing play (node and python), or by cloning a git repository (npm init).
